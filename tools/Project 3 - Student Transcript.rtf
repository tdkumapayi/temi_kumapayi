\f0\fs24 \cf0 Using MS Access, I was able to create a database that could be used to tag individuals with their identification and curate reports based on certain criteria selected by the user. The user would be inserted into the database and given an identification number that could be used to tie to, for example, a student\'92s grades over their four years of education. You could then categorize these by semester, year, and even calculate the student\'92s overall grade. A difficult aspect of this project was creating the report and understanding the different elements and how to manipulate them to create the report I wanted. I was able to successfully create a database that could create different reports based on certain filters. \
