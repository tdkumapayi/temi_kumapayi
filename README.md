### About Me 
Hello! I am an aspiring pediatrician and biohealth major with a year of proven experience in research and biological commercialization. 

With skills in problem-solving, personnel management, interpersonal relations, and effective communication,  I am able to support researchers and scientists in conducting research and resulting in findings beneficial in supporting familial units.  I am adept at using RStudio, MS Excel, and MS Outlook. 

My broad skill set, commitment to supporting my communities, and passion for learning and improvement make me a valuable asset.  In my spare time, I like to volunteer in the hospital and tutor students, and crochet.

### Projects

#### Budget Tracker 
 - I created an automated budget tracker that calculated the amount of money that I spent, what I had left, and my saving goals.

 - Using MS Excel, I successfully created a budget tracker to keep a record of my finances. This was done so I could have a broad overview and understand where money was coming in and what was going out. It allows for an understanding of where I need to make adjustments in my budget. While making the budget tracker, it was difficult to try and come up with a design/layout that would be the most optimal for my needs without becoming too long or too wide in length. I needed it to display the most information in an efficient but simplistic manner. I was able to make an automated budget tracker that adjusted itself based on the income I had for the week, making the calculations for me and plugging in the money accordingly. If I could go back and change it, I would format it so that the payments that are fixed, such as a phone bill or subscription plan, were more in one place, where areas with flexibility or varying amounts of money were in another.

#### Grade Calculator 
 - I created a grade calculator using MS Excel to calculate end-of-the-semester grades for my classes and keep on top of things. 
 - ![Here is my Grade Calculator!](/tools/grade.jpg)
 - Using MS Excel, I created a grade calculator that assisted me in calculating my grade for the end of the semester. This is greatly important to me, as an aspiring pediatrician, you need a high GPA to get into medical school, so ensuring my grades will remain up to the appropriate standard is very important. Using the calculator allows me to input grades for future assignments as well as to gauge what grade I must receive to remain in my target range. This elevates stress because then I know where I need to dedicate more energy and studying to versus another assignment. The biggest challenge I had for this project was the format as well. It’s hard to make a skeleton calculator when the needs, weights, and even number of assignments from class to class and semester to semester differ so greatly. If I could make some improvements, I would change the layout and try to make it as universal as possible to make it easy to use and access.

#### Databases 
 - I created a database using MS Access to create a database of grades for students across time. 
 - ![Here is my budget tracker!](/tools/jtranscript.jpg)
 - Using MS Access, I was able to create a database that could be used to tag individuals with their identification and curate reports based on certain criteria selected by the user. The user would be inserted into the database and given an identification number that could be used to tie to, for example, a student’s grades over their four years of education. You could then categorize these by semester, year, and even calculate the student’s overall grade. A difficult aspect of this project was creating the report and understanding the different elements and how to manipulate them to create the report I wanted. I was able to successfully create a database that could create different reports based on certain filters.
